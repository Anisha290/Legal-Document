This project aims to develop an abstractive summarization system for legal documents using large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA, while integrating a SQL database for structured storage and retrieval. Unlike extractive summarization, which picks out key sentences, this approach generates concise summaries that retain the meaning of the original text in a rewritten form. The system preprocesses legal documents using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, cleans the text by handling legal terminologies, and then applies a trained model to generate meaningful summaries. The summarized data, along with the original documents, is stored in an SQL database, allowing for efficient querying and retrieval. This project is particularly useful for lawyers, researchers, and legal professionals, helping them quickly understand lengthy legal texts without reading them in full.# Legal-Document
